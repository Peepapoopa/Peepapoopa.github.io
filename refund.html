    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>
Returns and Refunds: We offer exchange and returns on items which are either damaged or defected. We request our customers to make an opening video of  parcels as guided by our shipping partners to ensure if there is any damage due to mishandling. On our side we make a packaging video. After reviewing the package opening videos our quality team makes a decision on the refund or exchange.

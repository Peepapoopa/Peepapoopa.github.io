    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
    <p>
Shipping and Delivery: The majority of the products are made to order and may require a time frame of 7- 10 days other than the ones which are in stock. This is because we source directly from local artisans who do not deal in big quantities. We have a great network of shipping partners like Shiprocket in India and DHL, FEDEX, BLUEDART and UPS for international couriers. Once the product is shipped we notify our client on email by sharing the tracking/AWB bill of the consignment.
